🚀 Deploying WordPress with MySQL in Docker Containers! 🚀

I recently worked on a project where I containerized a WordPress server using Docker! 🐳 This setup makes deployment lightweight, portable, and efficient.

🔹 Steps I Followed:
✅ Pulled two essential Docker images: MySQL & WordPress
✅ Configured environment variables for MySQL (MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD)
✅ Launched the WordPress container and linked it to MySQL
✅ Accessed WordPress through the browser via the container's IP address
✅ Now, we can write and publish blogs seamlessly! ✍️✨

💡 Why Docker for WordPress?
🔹 Portability – Runs the same way on any system
🔹 Isolation – Each container runs independently
🔹 Scalability – Easy to scale WordPress for high traffic
🔹 Fast Deployment – No complex setups, just pull and run!

This project highlights the power of Docker and containerization in simplifying application deployment. Excited to explore more in DevOps and cloud technologies! 🚀
